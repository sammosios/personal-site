  'I work in DevOps with a strong interest in distributed systems, focusing on building infrastructure and services that scale, fail gracefully, and stay boringly reliable.',
  'I care deeply about understanding how things work under the hood — from cloud primitives to system design trade-offs — and I enjoy refining systems until complexity is earned, not accidental.',
  'Outside of tech, I\'m learning how to cook properly and exploring life in Sweden, one hike, café, and badly pronounced Swedish word at a time.',
